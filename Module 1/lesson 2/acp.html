            <h2>About Our School</h2>
            <h3><strong>Invocation</strong></h3>
            <p>Cantonment Public School and College, Saidpur, a beacon of education in northern Bangladesh, reflects the
                transformative power of learning. Founded under the leadership of <em><strong>Colonel S.M.
                        Shamsuzzaman</strong></em> and officially inaugurated by Major General H.M. Ershad on April 4,
                1979, the institution owes its foundation to the Bangladesh Army’s visionary commitment. The first
                academic building’s foundation was laid by President Lt General Ziaur Rahman in 1980. Starting with 5
                teachers and 176 students, CPSCS marked its academic journey with SSC exams in 1983 and HSC in 1986.
                Responding to evolving educational demands, the English Version School Section was launched in 1998 and
                the College Section in 2017.</p>

            <h3><strong>Academic Accolades</strong></h3>
            <p>CPSCS has consistently upheld academic excellence, winning the ‘Sena Prodhan Trophy’ twice for top HSC
                results among cantonment institutions. In 1993, a teacher earned the national ‘Best Teacher Award’,
                followed by the ‘Best Educational Institution’ title in 2002. It ranked among the top five colleges
                under Rajshahi Board in 2008 and gained global recognition with the British Council’s ‘International
                School Award’ in 2019. In 2020, it recorded the highest number of GPA-5 achievers in the Dinajpur Board,
                reaffirmed by strong HSC-2024 results across military institutions.</p>

            <h3><strong>Recognition in Co-curricular and Extra-curricular Activities</strong></h3>
            <p>CPSCS excels beyond academics. Its students won gold in the National Sports Competition (1994 & 1995) and
                the UNICEF Grand Prix Award in 2006. Recognition followed in Islamic competitions by the Islamic
                Foundation, national art contests, and the National Children’s Award in 2017. A student claimed the Best
                Costume Award at the 2020 international ‘Colors of Voice’ contest. In 2024, three students excelled in
                the International Leadership Program on Education 4.0 and IOELLS in Malaysia, while others achieved
                honors at IYSC Malaysia and WCCA Nepal. Domestically, 35 students were top performers at the NCCA-2024.
                Our students excelled in National Level of various Olympiads in 2025, earning 1st & 3rd in Bangla, 1st &
                3rd in ILPE, 3rd in Math, 4th & 23rd in Physics, 9th & 13th in Chemistry, 4th in Robotics, and 28th in
                Astronomy & Astrophysics Olympiad.</p>

            <h3><strong>Functioning Body</strong></h3>
            <p>Today, CPSCS serves around 4,400 students from Nursery to Class Twelve in both Bangla and English
                versions, supported by 146 faculty and 106 staff. The CPSCS Alumni Association, formed on its 38th
                anniversary, connects past and present students. Student leadership thrives through a 26-member prefect
                system. Co-curricular engagement is enriched by BNCC, Scouts, and 19 clubs. Facilities include ICT and
                science labs, smart classrooms, automation systems, generator backup, CCTV, and a roof truss space in
                the English Version Building for nine classrooms and an exam hall. Future expansions include two
                academic buildings, an administrative building, and a multipurpose complex. Transport services on key
                routes enhance student accessibility. The institution is governed by a body chaired by the Brigade and
                Station Commander, with the Principal as Member Secretary. Two former Governing Body Chairmen later
                became Chiefs of the Army, reflecting its prestige.</p>

            <h3><strong>Closing Reflections</strong></h3>
            <p>CPSCS continues to shape future leaders through its unwavering commitment to academic excellence,
                character development, and global engagement—cementing its status as a premier educational institution
                in Bangladesh.</p>
